### Course Structure | [See introductory description below.](#course-description)
Over the course of the semester, we will cover 4 topic areas that correspond to 4 parameters of choreography: Pathways, Form + Substance, Space and Timing + Pacing. Topics will be introduced through movement-based improvisation exercises. Computational strategies will be examined through code examples. For each topic, students will create a small movement study in 2 stages: the first analog, the second computational with the aim of fully exploring how technology "intervened" and changed the choreographic process.

The class will culminate in a showing of student work. Final projects can either be in the form of a tool to aid in movement practice, an interactive installation or a live performance.

Because course topics are organized around movement concepts, technical topics will be introduced and built upon week to week.
- What do cameras see? RGB, IR, Kinect, Mocap...
- Skeletons, Depth Maps and Silhouettes
- Basic programming concepts: Variables, Conditionals, Loops, Arrays
- 2D v. 3D
- Drawing and animation
- Random, noise, oscillation, easing, etc.
- Calculating velocity and acceleration
- Mapping values
- Manipulating text, sound and live image processing

"Soft Skills" we will practice:
- Sketching (as in drawing on paper) choreographic ideas.
- Defining rule sets for movement.
- Defining rules of interaction.
- Deconstructing choreography into parameters for code.
- Extracting choreographic ideas from code.

# Course Description
Even where there is no connection between 2 events, if they happen at the same time, in the same space, we find relationships nonetheless.

So then what is the point of hooking up dancers to sensing devices to connect them to various media if the relationships already exist in our minds? Simply seeing a cause-and-effect relationship between movement (input) and media (output) is not enough.

This course re-conceives interactive media as a form of choreographic intervention. Instead of asking how dancers can control media, we will turn the tables to ask how interactive systems can influence movement. How do you make someone feel soft inside? How do you shake an entire room? How do you orchestrate duets between strangers?

To accomplish this, choreographers must learn to apply computational thinking to choreography and programmers need to be able to apply choreographic thinking to computation. To whatever extent possible, we will attempt to embody code.

Using computer vision and a broad range of media from graphics and video, to sound and text, we will look at directing both how people move (quality of movement) as well as where they move (pathways and spatial relationships).

We will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the various sensing technologies available to us today. How wide is the gulf between what we can see and feel (strength, hardness, contortion) and what a computer can see and interpret (locations, contours, velocity, acceleration)? Class time will be split between movement exercises, playing with examples and deconstructing code.

The course is cross-listed with the Tisch Dance MFA department. All assignments will be collaborations between ITP and Tisch Dance students. The class will culminate in a final showing.

## Pre-requisites
The course is intended both for anyone looking to deepen their practice in working with movement-based interaction regardless of previous experience with movement technique or programming.

As a result, there is no pre-requisite for dance and no pre-requisite for code.

## Grading
- 40% for showing up (on time!) and participating with curiosity and enthusiasm.
- 10% for each topic study.
- 20% for the final project.
- More than 2 unexcused absences qualifies you for a failure.
- 2 lateness of 15 minutes or more qualifies as 1 unexcused absence.
